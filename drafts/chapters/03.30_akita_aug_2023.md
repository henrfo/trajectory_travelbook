### 26th August 2023:
Morioka

Hunter S. Thompson would have said: Akita isn't just rural Japan - it's where the Japanese Dream goes to die a slow, sake-soaked death. 

Mind you, I just got here. And Akita is not some place I know like the back of my hand. Akita is the city in Northern Japan (a country I never visited in a continent I've never been before). I fucking got here to Akita on Thursday, today is Saturday. I'm already leaving again. Wosh wosh. Let's get outta here.

I say goodbye to my very new friends. I take the bus, pay with my physical suica card, I get to Wada station, slightly north of campus, now I have to take the train West, into Akita Station in downtown of Akita City, although Morioka is straight East. The shinkansen even goes through at Wada station, it just doesn't stop there tho. Akita City is probably the Japanese equivalent of Kristiansand and some other Norwegian city where you don't wanna live, (No disrespect to Akita), so finding the shinkansen is not too hard. I feel the sweat drip down on my forehead. No one ever told me Japan is this hot. I find the right platform, and the shinkansen arrives a few moments later. I get on it. Find a seat. I'm sitting on the left hand side, meaning, I'm staring north, and it's about 5-6 PM (CHECK!), so I get to see the beautiful light at dusk.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/akita_shinkansen.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

This sweaty, large Norwegian on the shinkansen. We're picking up speed. I feel so foreign. This is likely one of the first, but one of many moments I feel like this large, white being from the North. Every time I mention Norway, I hear people mention salmon and northern lights. I never thought about it that way. Also, I never miss Kristiansand or Oslo so far, I can only think about Svalbard. It reminds me of the most extreme sides of my country. The arctic. The polar environment. I learn that the Japanese word for polar bear is shirokuma (shiro = white, kuma = bear). This is what I feel like. I'm a large, white, foreign being in some distant place, where I'm not even sure I should be.

The rice fields and overgrown forests of Akita prefecture flashes at me, zap zap, the shinkansen travels fast, although the ride is a smooth one. Rice field after rice field, forests, signs with letters I don't recognize, flash flash, buildings with distinct Japanese features, zap zap, it all snags at me so hastily. And I see the sun go down somewhere in the middle of Akita and Morioka. Japan is cool and all. Like it's a cool experience for a vacation.  My overall feeling is mainly focused on; holy fuck -- I'm here. And I'm on my own. So fully, like, to an extent I've never ever been before. It's liberating. It's crushing. Who am I when no one else is around. I guess I'm about to find out.

- Soul Bamboo by Minoru Muraoka

On the shinkansen, I didn't actually listen to this song at the time, but this is what it felt like. When I travel I feel so fucking free. Or maybe not traveling. But being far away from home, and alone, and independent. I don't fully know what it is. I feel free from all the shit that I ever experienced in my hometown, the suffocation norms of Norway, and at the same time I feel trapped. I feel trapped because I'm broke, and I know I'm dependent on so much. Here, and so many other places, I hope to go back one time with more financial breathing room. I'm listening to "INTERLUDE 3" from BES's new album called "STANCE", which is the sole reason why I'm going to Morioka. 

I check in to my room quickly. No time to waste. A quick shower and change my shirt, and I go out. I decide to sit at the bar, and I'm eating and drinking alone. Probably one of my favorite activities. I can't decide on the food so I end up ordering both chicken wings and gyozas. It's too much food. Even for me. I walked in, but I'm rolling out. I have one beer. I think two.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_evening.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

I'm on this dark street. There's a small staircase a few floors down below ground floor. The walls are claustrophobically white. It's giving narrow slide at some nightmarish water park. This can't be the right place. I remind you, on a random dark street in Morioka, a Saturday in late August, I walk down these stairs. What the fuck have I gotten myself in to. At the bottom, there's a large black door; I can slightly hear some music behind it. I open it cautiously. Who woulda thought. There is Taiki, the guy I met together with Tikini in Shibuya. He greets me with a big smile. I pay some small cover charge and I walk in.

Okay. So what is this. There's a bar on the right. On the left there's some seating and a few low tables up against the wall. Straight forward, in the middle of the room, there is a small stage. The room is long, narrow, and snug. The place is not crowded at all. I'd say it's about 10-15 people in here. They're playing some hip hop, and its great tho. There's multiple guys behind the mixers. Some people are smoking inside, like this basement needed to come off as even more hazy and dark than it already is. I guess this is a part of the experience tho.

I hear some guys speak American on my left. Clearly military. We later talk and I get to hear that they're from a base in Aomori. Air Force, they say. We have the usual Norwegian-American conversation about Norwegian beer prices, healthcare, and some talk about political systems. I don't remember it too well, and to be honest, lets skip the rest of this.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_dj_1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

I walk further in the room, I see Tikini busy by the stage and the turntables. I've already bought a beer, an asahi, and walk up to the stage. He greets me and gives me dap. He mentions that he didn't think he'd see me here. That I'd actually show up. I'm not really surprised myself. My whole life is just me getting lead astray and ending up in the weirdest places you've heard about. I love it tho.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_dj_2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

Any way, he introduces me to a few people. Some music guy from Tokyo. Everyone respects this guy. Or they fear him. I'm not actually sure. However, you can tell people behave differently around this guy than they do with any other person in this room. I hear that he runs a record label in Tokyo. But the physical presence and the psychological space he takes up, that's not it, what I'm talking about is something else. He's just louder, and it seems like he feels obligated, or allowed to take up more space than any other person here. In Norwegian, or even American culture, he'd be categorized as loud. In a Japanese setting, this is borderline vulgar.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_boys.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

I chat with these four youngin's from Aomori, and they make me promise that I'll send them the pictures I take of them. It's dark, and I try using my phone as a flash, making it more visible, but the pictures come out exponentially as bad. I get lucky and catch the eyes of the guy on the right just as the yellow light sway over us.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_concert_1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

The concert, it's good, but I mostly listened to interlude 3 -- a simple interlude, so no lyrics. As it goes on, at one point BES, the main artist, during one of the breaks between songs he points to me and cracks a joke about me in Japanese. I don't get a single word of it at the time, Tikini knows about everyone at this venue, so I know I'm not gonna be made fun of in a bad way. He leans in and tells me that BES cracked a joke about the blonde bear in the front. He's not too wrong.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_concert_2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

Tikini buys a shot for me and a couple of other guys. KANPAI! After downing the shot, we sit on the black leather seats, the ones on the other side of the bar. I'm sitting with the Tokyo-label-guy, and we try to have a chat. To be fair, he doesn't speak too much English. He's likely just learnt the few phrases he repeats from American hip hop, because he repeats them over and over, and we're not really having a conversation; we're just pretending that we have one.

I say goodbye to my new friends, unsure if I'll ever see them again. Like, for the rest of my life. I stagger up the white, gleaming staircase. After hours in this dark, gloomy basement, this white staircase feels like it's leading to heaven. It feels good finally escaping the smoke downstairs, the music loud as it's hot in a boiling kettle. I'm unsure of what I was just a part of. The music was just perfect, these were my people, I could tell it from what they were playing tonight. I step outside. This is not heaven tho. None the less, I take a breath of fresh air. Not too deep. The temperature is not as cold as I'd wish for, but it's fresh, and the temperature is still comfortable in just a shirt. Finally, a comfortable break from the heat, and all the sweating, daytime, and now night time too in some random basement. 

It's pitch black outside. I take a look at my watch. I have to focus, with one eye half-closed and the other one slowly calibrating, I can tell it's only 02:41, or already 02:41, depending on how you see it. I put one feet in front of the other, this still feels manageable, and I continue like this. I walk back the dark street that I came from. I feel safe tho. I look left, it's a dark, quiet ally, it feels right. So I take this sudden left. Night walks like these, happily drunk, feeling safe; I'm 188 cm tall and 100+ kgs. I'm basically two Japanese guys -- a walking violation of Japanese spatial aesthetics -- so it's good. And knowing that I'm both the loneliest man on the planet, but that I have people that care for me on the other side of this circle, now that feels great.

### 27th August 2023:
Morioka

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/morioka_woman.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

Flash flash, zap zap, I'm back in Akita just as quickly as I left it.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/akita_station.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

The view from the station in Akita City is stunning, me on the other end, I must've realized it partly since I took a photo, however, I have no recollection of actually thinking the surrounding mountains were that beautiful.

<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="../../images/countries/japan/aiu_sunday_august.jpg" alt="" style="width: 60%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

After that, I'm taking the train to Wada station, and then the bus to Akita International University. The campus is beautifully placed in the middle of nowhere. So, then you ask; then there must be a lot of beautiful nature nearby. Yes, but it's not as accessible as you might think. The forest's are packed with Asian black bears -- small, but holy fuck they're aggressive. If you don't believe me, search for "akita bear attack". We were even warned about using noise cancellation headsets while walking ON campus. The dorms, the university, the one bar, two cafe's and a small, locally run convenience store was all grouped in this small, little secluded area. While the people working there were great, the description of multiple cafe's, a bar, and so on, provides a limited description of reality. We had what we needed, but not any more than that.
