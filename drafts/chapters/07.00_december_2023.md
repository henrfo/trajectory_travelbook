Last night in Tokyo. Right there, while running for the last subway for the night at Shibuya station.

I remember the feeling as surreal, but also damning, in the sense that the underlaying condition of all these travels is how fleeting all these moments and interactions are. And there is little you can do to help it.

I didnâ€™t know what to say. What I remember most vividly is walking out of the station, toward the capsule hotel, where all my friends would soon arrive.
