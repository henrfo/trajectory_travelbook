## Chapter 3: Farther And Fainter; First meeting with Japan
Song: Farther And Fainter by John Tejada.

### Japanese border patrol and a brown banana

Everything felt overwhelming. And I think it is difficult to properly convey the extent of overwhelm. Because there are so many factors to consider and also take into account. After travelling close to 30 hours after 1.5 hour of sleep, to then change not only flight, but pick up the luggage, then also bus take a bus to change terminal, then check in luggage and everything again, with less than one hour layover. And remember, all of this going on in Japanese. I’m in Tokyo changing flights, and everything is so incredibly overwhelming. Meeting the couple from the flight, on their way back to Fukuoka. I got my documentation, a Japanese citizen card. Feeling super proud. And

Flying from Tokyo to Okinawa, I remember looking at this image of my grandfather, especially when Mt. Fuji appeared behind the clouds. He lived long enough to hear me tell him I'd study in Japan and Australia. Although he did not know much about these places, he was always all ears when I visited them and he was always happy on my behalf.

My grandfather, Roar Nodeland, as a kid.

### Generations and possibilities
I often think about all the possibilities I have, that e.g. my grandparents didn't have, to put it in perspective. My grandparents only left Norway a handful of times, with the longest travel being their one trip to Turkey, except this I believe they only went to other Scandinavian countries. Therefore, me being a spiring academic, and travelling to places like Japan, represents distances further than just geographical ones. They cross cultural, generational, and socioeconomic boundaries.

My grandparents would often talk about our relatives that left Norway to pursue a better life in America, which happened frequently in Norwegian families between the 1820s and the 1920s. My grandmother would always reference that one relative that went on to live in Brooklyn. She would say it with the broadest southern Norwegian dialect and accent, more like BRÅKLYN. Growing up, I also remember hearing about  However, she too was always incredibly supportive and encouraging, despite her struggles with remembering given her age and dementia.

### Arriving in Okinawa
Arriving in Okinawa. Eating chicken. Being so sleepy, and fully just knocked out. 35 Celsius, the most demanding humidity I have ever experienced. T

### Waking up in Okinawa -- same evening as the day I arrived (9th August 2023)
Then waking up around 10 pm, super hungry, just going to go out for a quick snack before bed again. Also, remember, you’re constantly trying to gauge different factors like the safety, and where to eat? And maybe I should go get a drink somewhere. Is this place safe?
