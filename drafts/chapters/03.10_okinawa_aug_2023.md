## Chapter 3: Farther And Fainter; First meeting with Japan
Song: Farther And Fainter by John Tejada.

### Japanese border patrol and a brown banana

Everything felt overwhelming. And I think it is difficult to properly convey the extent of overwhelm. Because there are so many factors to consider and also take into account. After travelling close to 30 hours after 1.5 hour of sleep, to then change not only flight, but pick up the luggage, then also bus take a bus to change terminal, then check in luggage and everything again, with less than one hour layover. And remember, all of this going on in Japanese. I’m in Tokyo changing flights, and everything is so incredibly overwhelming. Meeting the couple from the flight, on their way back to Fukuoka. I got my documentation, a Japanese citizen card. Feeling super proud. And

Flying from Tokyo to Okinawa, I remember looking at this image of my grandfather, especially when Mt. Fuji appeared behind the clouds. He lived long enough to hear me tell him I'd study in Japan and Australia. Although he did not know much about these places, he was always all ears when I visited them and he was always happy on my behalf.

### Generations and possibilities
I often think about all the possibilities I have, that e.g. my grandparents didn't have, to put it in perspective. My grandparents only left Norway a handful of times, with the longest travel being their one trip to Turkey, except this I believe they only went to other Scandinavian countries. Therefore, me being a spiring academic, and travelling to places like Japan, represents distances further than just geographical ones. They cross cultural, generational, and socioeconomic boundaries.

My grandparents would often talk about our relatives that left Norway to pursue a better life in America, which happened frequently in Norwegian families between the 1820s and the 1920s. My grandmother would always reference that one relative that went on to live in Brooklyn. She would say it with the broadest southern Norwegian dialect and accent, more like BRÅKLYN. Growing up, I also remember hearing about  However, she too was always incredibly supportive and encouraging, despite her struggles with remembering given her age and dementia.

### Arriving in Okinawa
Arriving in Okinawa. Eating chicken. Being so sleepy, and fully just knocked out. 35 Celsius, the most demanding humidity I have ever experienced. T

### Waking up in Okinawa -- same evening as the day I arrived (9th August 2023)
Then waking up around 10 pm, super hungry, just going to go out for a quick snack before bed again. Also, remember, you’re constantly trying to gauge different factors like the safety, and where to eat? And maybe I should go get a drink somewhere. Is this place safe?

I remember this walk home, a bit drunk, very tired, and all alone on the other side of the world, as a amazing, and realizing moment that I actually did it. I'm all alone in Okinawa. I've never even been in Asia before. But I did it. I'm here.

### 10th August 2023:
Moving to American Village, close to Kadena Airbase, where the military jets were flying over all day and all night long. And the humidity, it was the most extreme I've ever experienced.

I remember walking over here. Looking for food. Despite it being dark outside and starting to get quite late, I'd been compeltely knocked out after diving -- being picked up at 6 AM -- and then getting back in the afternoon. I'm usually able to not fall asleep, even when I'm tired, but these days I was just knocked out cold when I got. Therefore, it wasn't until late that got out to look for food. In this area, everything was mainly tailored to Americans, while I was hoping to get some Japanese food. I walked along the ocean, with a great view of southern parts of Okinawa main island, and had to stop a few times because of the heavy humnidity. After a 20 minute walk I arrived at an area with lower rise buildings, and looked around for restaurants that still were open, despite it being late in the evening. I arrived at this place, you had to walk up a few stairs, and there was a curtain, all over giving the impression of a closed off venue, if even a restaurant, and likely not very open for foreigners. However, I opened the door, peeked in, and was greeting like any other person -- I mean, in a very good way. I felt welcome and sat down on the chair on the left hand side of the bar.

For the first ten minutes I was left alone, and nobody except the Korean waitress approached me -- to take my order. I even remember listening to music on my earplugs. After ordering some great skewers, a Okinawan beer, plus some dry sake (from Yamagata), the others in the bar, both staff and guests -- who clearly knew each other -- started opening a spanish bottle of red wine, and I soon understood that it was one of the people in the restaurants birthday. To my surprise, I received a glass of red wine too, which quickly led me to feel both very included and grateful. I asked who's birthday it was, and it was one of the two chef's. Then, one of the male guest joked about me singing the Japanese birthday song, which I clearly didn't know. But I said, I do know the Norwegian one, and I can sing that. They all said yes, so there I was in a slightly hidden Okinawan restaurant singing "Gratulerer med dagen" to this chef. They all stayed silent while I was singing, with the best intentions, although not the best outcome. When I was done it was clear that they appreciated the gesture, and the rest of the evening we shared stories and drinks, and I got some surprised facial expressions when I told them that I was going to live and study in Akita for five months. Based on their reactions, it seemed to be probably one of the more secluded and less 'relevant' places I could go across the whole of Japan. It might have been. I was told Akita was one of the most rural places with high numbers in both alcoholism and depression. One of the guys in the restaurant told me that he wanted to drink with me, as in heavy drinking, and we did try to figure out a day to meet up. But since my time in Okinawa was very limited, and I was gonna be picked up at 6 AM the next morning, I couldn't stay into the early morning or schedule anything. I was already overwhelmed as is. I thanked them all for a heart warming interaction and left the bar. I remember walking the dark streets of Okinawa home and back to my shitty hotel room to try and catch some hours of sleep.
