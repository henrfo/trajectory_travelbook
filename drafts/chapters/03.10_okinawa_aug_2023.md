## Chapter 3: Farther And Fainter; First meeting with Japan
Song: Farther And Fainter by John Tejada.

### Japanese border patrol and a brown banana

Everything felt overwhelming. And I think it is difficult to properly convey the extent of overwhelm. Because there are so many factors to consider and also take into account. After travelling close to 30 hours after 1.5 hour of sleep, to then change not only flight, but pick up the luggage, then also bus take a bus to change terminal, then check in luggage and everything again, with less than one hour layover. And remember, all of this going on in Japanese. I’m in Tokyo changing flights, and everything is so incredibly overwhelming. Meeting the couple from the flight, on their way back to Fukuoka. I got my documentation, a Japanese citizen card. Feeling super proud. And

Flying from Tokyo to Okinawa, I remember looking at this image of my grandfather, especially when Mt. Fuji appeared behind the clouds. He lived long enough to hear me tell him I'd study in Japan and Australia. Although he did not know much about these places, he was always all ears when I visited them and he was always happy on my behalf.

My grandfather, Roar Nodeland, as a kid.

### Generations and possibilities
I often think about all the possibilities I have, that e.g. my grandparents didn't have, to put it in perspective. My grandparents only left Norway a handful of times, with the longest travel being their one trip to Turkey, except this I believe they only went to other Scandinavian countries. Therefore, me being a spiring academic, and travelling to places like Japan, represents distances further than just geographical ones. They cross cultural, generational, and socioeconomic boundaries.

My grandparents would often talk about our relatives that left Norway to pursue a better life in America, which happened frequently in Norwegian families between the 1820s and the 1920s. My grandmother would always reference that one relative that went on to live in Brooklyn. She would say it with the broadest southern Norwegian dialect and accent, more like BRÅKLYN. Growing up, I also remember hearing about  However, she too was always incredibly supportive and encouraging, despite her struggles with remembering given her age and dementia.

### 9-10th August 2023:
### Arriving in Okinawa
Arriving in Okinawa. Eating chicken. Being so sleepy, and fully just knocked out. 35 Celsius, the most demanding humidity I have ever experienced. T

### Waking up in Okinawa -- same evening as the day I arrived (9th August 2023)
Then waking up around 10 pm, super hungry, just going to go out for a quick snack before bed again. Also, remember, you’re constantly trying to gauge different factors like the safety, and where to eat? And maybe I should go get a drink somewhere. Is this place safe?

I remember this walk home, a bit drunk, very tired, and all alone on the other side of the world, as a amazing, and realizing moment that I actually did it. I'm all alone in Okinawa. I've never even been in Asia before. But I did it. I'm here.

### 11th August 2023:
Keramas - Yuki

### 12th August 2023:
Moving to American Village, close to Kadena Airbase, where the military jets were flying over all day and all night long. And the humidity, it was the most extreme I've ever experienced. 

Otávio
<div style="text-align: center;"><p align="center"><img src="/images/countries/japan/okinawa_boat_diving.jpg" alt="Boat for diving in Okinawa" style="width: 80%; max-width: 400px;; margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p></div>

I remember walking over here. Looking for food. Despite it being dark outside and starting to get quite late, I'd been completely knocked out after diving -- being picked up at 6 AM -- and then getting back in the afternoon. I'm usually able to not fall asleep, even when I'm tired, but these days I was just knocked out cold when I got. Therefore, it wasn't until late that got out to look for food. In this area, everything was mainly tailored to Americans, while I was hoping to get some Japanese food. I walked along the ocean, with a great view of southern parts of Okinawa main island, and had to stop a few times because of the heavy humnidity. After a 20 minute walk I arrived at an area with lower rise buildings, and looked around for restaurants that still were open, despite it being late in the evening. I arrived at this place, you had to walk up a few stairs, and there was a curtain, all over giving the impression of a closed off venue, if even a restaurant, and likely not very open for foreigners. However, I opened the door, peeked in, and was greeting like any other person -- I mean, in a very good way. I felt welcome and sat down on the chair on the left hand side of the bar.

For the first ten minutes I was left alone, and nobody except the Korean waitress approached me -- to take my order. I even remember listening to music on my earplugs. After ordering some great skewers, a Okinawan beer, plus some dry sake (from Yamagata), the others in the bar, both staff and guests -- who clearly knew each other -- started opening a spanish bottle of red wine, and I soon understood that it was one of the people in the restaurants birthday. To my surprise, I received a glass of red wine too, which quickly led me to feel both very included and grateful. I asked who's birthday it was, and it was one of the two chef's. Then, one of the male guest joked about me singing the Japanese birthday song, which I clearly didn't know. But I said, I do know the Norwegian one, and I can sing that. They all said yes, so there I was in a slightly hidden Okinawan restaurant singing "Gratulerer med dagen" to this chef. They all stayed silent while I was singing, with the best intentions, although not the best outcome. When I was done it was clear that they appreciated the gesture, and the rest of the evening we shared stories and drinks, and I got some surprised facial expressions when I told them that I was going to live and study in Akita for five months. Based on their reactions, it seemed to be probably one of the more secluded and less 'relevant' places I could go across the whole of Japan. It might have been. I was told Akita was one of the most rural places with high numbers in both alcoholism and depression. One of the guys in the restaurant told me that he wanted to drink with me, as in heavy drinking, and we did try to figure out a day to meet up. But since my time in Okinawa was very limited, and I was gonna be picked up at 6 AM the next morning, I couldn't stay into the early morning or schedule anything. I was already overwhelmed as is. I thanked them all for a heart warming interaction and left the bar. I remember walking the dark streets of Okinawa home and back to my shitty hotel room to try and catch some hours of sleep.


-----

I'm wandering these dark Okinawan streets like some kind of sleep-deprived food pilgrim - six AM pickup for diving, knocked unconscious by afternoon sun and saltwater, and now it's late and I'm starving but everything here is tailored for American military families wanting familiar comfort food (McDonald's and Subway bleeding neon into humid darkness) when what I actually want is to taste this place, not some sanitized version of it. The ocean stretches out to my left, southern Okinawa main island floating in black water like a Hiroshige landscape painting, but I keep having to stop every few blocks because this humidity is like walking through liquid air - your lungs have to work to extract oxygen from this thick, breathing atmosphere that clings to your skin like a fever dream.

Twenty minutes of trudging through this warm soup of air and I find myself in an area where the buildings crouch lower, more intimate, and there's this place - you have to climb a few stairs, curtain hanging across the entrance like a secret, the whole composition screaming "closed to outsiders" or possibly "not even a restaurant" - but I'm past the point of caring about cultural appropriateness or whether I belong here (spoiler: I definitely don't), so I pull back that curtain and peek inside.

The Korean waitress greets me like I'm just another human being needing food, not some lost Norwegian stumbling around after dark, and I claim the leftmost barstool like it's my designated spot in this accidental theater. For ten minutes I'm invisible, earbuds in, watching this little world function around me - staff and regulars who clearly know each other's stories, the comfortable choreography of a neighborhood place - until they start opening this Spanish red wine and suddenly I understand: someone's birthday is happening here.

Then - and this is where the whole evening tilts into beautiful absurdity - they hand me a glass too. Just like that. I'm included in this celebration for reasons I can't comprehend, and when they joke about me singing the Japanese birthday song (which obviously I don't know), I hear myself saying "I know the Norwegian one" and they're all nodding yes before I can think about what I'm agreeing to.

So there I am, slightly drunk Norwegian standing in this hidden Okinawan restaurant, belting out "Gratulerer med dagen" to a chef I met twenty minutes ago while everyone goes completely silent - not uncomfortable silence, but the kind of respectful quiet you give someone attempting something ridiculous with good intentions. When I finish, their faces tell me the gesture landed even if the execution was questionable, and suddenly we're sharing stories and drinks like old friends who just met.

That's when I mention Akita, and their expressions shift - not quite horror, but close. "Akita? For five months?" One guy starts listing statistics about rural depression and alcoholism like he's reading my future obituary, and another offers to drink heavily with me (as in, destructively heavily) before I leave, but I'm already overwhelmed just existing in this moment, knowing I'll be picked up at six AM for another day of scuba diving and pretending I know what I'm doing.

Walking back through empty streets to my shitty hotel room, I'm processing the whole surreal evening - how you can stumble into belonging in the most unlikely places, how warmth can appear from behind curtains when you're brave enough to peek inside, how singing badly in your native language can somehow translate perfectly across every cultural barrier you thought existed.
