### 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake
On 1st January 2024 an Mw 7.5 earthquake occurred along an active fault across the Noto Peninsula. The hazards caused damage to buildings and infrastructure and more than 240 deaths. As usual, most casualties were caused by building collapse, but there was a high incidence of death by hypothermia and cold, which is different from the impact of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and reflects the harsher winter climate of this Noto Peninsula. (Suppasri et al, 2024).

Last night in Tokyo. Right there, while running for the last subway for the night at Shibuya station.

I remember the feeling as surreal, but also damning, in the sense that the underlaying condition of all these travels is how fleeting all these moments and interactions are. And there is little you can do to help it.

I didn’t know what to say. What I remember most vividly is walking out of the station, toward the capsule hotel, where all my friends would soon arrive.
