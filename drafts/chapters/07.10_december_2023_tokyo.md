#### Written on the 31st December 2023:
"It’s already been a few weeks of goodbyes. And  I have now entered my last week in Japan — for now.

I’ve met so many people that I will miss, and there’s so many places I would like to go back to. And yet so much more to discover.

I often get the feeling that I only borrowed all these experiences, and that they are too great to stay with me for the rest of my life. But they will. And I’m deeply grateful for that.

I will remember this year as the year of friendships, smiles and receiving a lot of help and support. From new friends. From Japanese friends. And from my close friends and family in Norway. I wouldn’t have been able to do this on my own.

I’m the worlds luckiest man surrounded by great people. Thank you! And see you soon. Best wishes for 2024."

### 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake
On 1st January 2024 an Mw 7.5 earthquake occurred along an active fault across the Noto Peninsula. The hazards caused damage to buildings and infrastructure and more than 240 deaths. As usual, most casualties were caused by building collapse, but there was a high incidence of death by hypothermia and cold, which is different from the impact of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and reflects the harsher winter climate of this Noto Peninsula. (Suppasri et al, 2024).

### 6th January 2024
Last night in Tokyo. Right there, while running for the last subway for the night at Shibuya station.

I remember the feeling as surreal, but also damning, in the sense that the underlaying condition of all these travels is how fleeting all these moments and interactions are. And there is little you can do to help it.

I didn’t know what to say. What I remember most vividly is walking out of the station, toward the capsule hotel, where all my friends would soon arrive.
