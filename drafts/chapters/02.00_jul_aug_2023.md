The place where I grew up. Now staring toward the sea, mentally preparing for the travel to Japan, and possibly being away from Oslo for 14 months in one stretch. Representing a specter of challenges, but also opportunities. Never having been in Japan, nor Asia nor Oceania before.

### Lunch with Kjetil and Timon
- Great colleagues
- Kjetil, also from the south of Norway, has been travelling a lot both on his own and through work. We have a running gag about me never having been to an airport lounge, which a few days before the departure, lead to him transferring the amount of money needed to get into the lounge at Gardermoen. A great gesture that I deeply appreciate.

### Leaving Oslo -- 8th August 2023:
The evening before leaving I was sure I wouldn't make it. I was packing like crazy, but I couldn't fit everything into the limited suitcases that I could bring.

As my mother drove to the hotel at Gardermoen, Oslo Airport, I was exhausted, and I remember parking in this gravel parking lot in the middle of nowhere. I took a shower and had a few hours of sleep, from about 1 or 2 AM to aroun 3:30 or 4 AM.

Next morning, meaning a few hours later, we got up, drove the few remaining minutes to the airport, and we started carrying my stuff over on a cart. Entering the main hall of Gardermoen we started moving toward the baggage check-in. The night before it was the final drop when I realized that I wouldnt be able to fit all in the two bags, and a backpack.

Remember, I was packing clothes for -20 celsius all the way up to +35 celsius, getting ready to deal with the weather in Okinawa in August, and Hokkaido in January, and everything in between that. How the hell do you even pack for a full year abroad like that. And in total being away from Oslo for 14 months, except for the few days I was back to repack my bags before departing on this trip.

Any way, back to the baggage check-in at Gardermoen, the lady working there was very understanding and helped me out. She accepted three bags, a blessing at the time, although travelling with three bags, hand luggage and a backpack might have been a bit over the top. At the same time, one of those bags mainly consisted of the underwater house and camera, and the handluggage was a pelicase full of camera equipment, while another of the bags were mostly used for scuba diving equipment. As I said to myself at the time, why did I buy the underwaterhouse and the camera if I'm not gonna use it when going to Japan, Thailand and Australia, which is a fair point, and at the same time, a great burden, actually a burden of 100 kgs.

At the check-in, I had forgotten that my leatherman (which also includes a fair sized knife) was still in the pelicase with all the camera equipment, which thankfully was picked up by the airport security. I remember the guy saying that I could either throw it away - mind you it's about a 100$ for a new one - or I could walk out of the line, put it somewhere, then leave. He stated it was no option that I could walk over to my mother, likely no more than ten meters away, and give it to here, as he said; I could receive or pick-up something illegal then. He called the manager over, and I asked if not he or the manager could walk over to my mother to hand over the leatherman tool, which the manager kindly agreed to.

Now, after spending a bit of time on this, I had no time to waste getting to that lounge.

If it wasn't for my mother, I very likely wouldn't have been able to make it to that plane, leaving Gardermoen, Oslo Airport.

### Layover in Munich

Falling asleep on the bench.

Boarding the plane, all I could hear was Japanese, and a few people talking Spanish a few rows back. It all felt so incredibly foreign, to an extent I have never felt before.
