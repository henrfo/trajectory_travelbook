## Introduction

### Dedicated to my grandparents:
This book is dedicated to my grandparents, Roar Nodeland (17.07.1936 - 08.09.2023) and Bjørg Nodeland (15.08.1938 - 03.01.2025), whom I hold so dearly.
Thank you for all your love and support, providing me with stability, and with all your hard work ultimately extending to making all the opportunities throughout this book accessible to me. Your love contributed to giving me the dare and the will to try and approach the world head-first.

### Fading Memories
A quote I came across during my travels, in a visual neuroscience-lecture by Prof. Simon Cropper at the University of Melbourne, was Susan Sontag's statement that “existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past, present, and future” (Cioran, 1968, p. 7). I was later able to find the quote in the foreword of the book “The Temptation to Exist” by Emil Cioran.

Later, I came to realize how this quote touches on something very vulnerable and frail about human existence. First, setting out on this whole journey, made it clear to me how the goodbyes, especially to my grandparents, very likely could be the final goodbye. And with my grandfather, it was. I never set out to write a book while I was travelling -- I had too much on my mind at the time, and enough with just travelling -- I got back home, and realized nobody knows the experiences I went through, and maybe the most delicate part; these memories are slipping away from me, already. Even if its just a few months, or years ago. Later on, if I get to grow old, I believe I would regret deeply not having written down all these memories and experiences. This was my life at its purest and its rawest. And although the process of leaving, and the process of returning, both were incredibly hard -- they seem to have created the grounds for the most fertile soil for new beginnings.
