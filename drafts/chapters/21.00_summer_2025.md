## 'Remind Me' by Royksopp
It's only been a week
The rush of being home in rapid fading
Failing to recall
What I was missing all that time in England
Has sent me aimlessly
On foot or by the help of transportation
To knock on windows where
A friend no longer live, I had forgotten

And anywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place and time
Where love that traveled far had found me
We stayed outside 'til two
Waiting for the light to come back
But hidden talk I knew
Until you asked what I was thinking
Until you asked what I was thinking

Brave men tell the truth
The wise men's tools are analogies and puzzles
A woman holds her tongue
Knowing silence will speak for her
Brave men tell the truth
The wise men's tools are analogies and puzzles
A woman holds her tongue
Knowing silence will speak for her
Will speak for her

And everywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place and time
Where love that travelled far had found me
